        <h2>Love letter</h2>
        <h4>I don’t know how to write something perfect,
            so I’ll just write what I honestly feel.
            
            I like the way you exist — quietly, naturally, without trying too hard.
            You don’t force your way into anyone’s life,
            but once you’re there, things don’t feel the same without you.
            
            I like how you are on normal days,
            not just when you’re smiling,
            but even when you’re tired, irritated, or silent.
            Those parts matter to me too.
            
            Sometimes I don’t say much,
            but that doesn’t mean I don’t notice.
            I notice the little things —
            the way you react, the way you listen,
            the way you stay true to yourself.
            That’s what pulled me closer, without me even realizing it.
            
            I’m not perfect, and I won’t pretend to be.
            But what I feel for you is real.
            I care in a quiet way —
            the kind that stays, even when things aren’t easy.
            
            If one day life feels heavy,
            I may not have all the answers,
            but I’ll be there, standing next to you.
            And if love means choosing someone,
            then I know who I’d choose — every single time.
            
            — Me 🤍</h4>
